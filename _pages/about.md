## A Walk Through Emirati Girlhood 


 An immersive experience that celebrates contemporary Emirati girlhood in a multicultural setting. This installation features soulful oud music and a symbolic palm tree trunk with leaves projecting words reflecting Emirati girls' experiences and things they heard growing up. Audience members can add their perspectives via an interactive QR code, fostering cross-cultural dialogue. The tree's movable trunk segments, decorated in traditional and modern fabrics, allow the audience to visually blend past and present, illustrating the evolution from structured childhood traditions to today's modernity and the many influences taking place in current Emirati girlhood's experience.
