# Capstone Elevator Pitch

We're creating an immersive experience that celebrates the journey of contemporary Emirati girlhood in a multicultural landscape. Our installation intertwines soulful oud music, and a symbolic palm tree trunk, where leaves project the words echoing the experiences of Emirati girls and the tree trunk segments serve as a physical interactive element that further showcases the mixing of influences on Emirati girl fabrics and fashion. With an interactive QR code, we invite our audience to contribute their own perspectives, fostering a cross-cultural dialogue. Everyone is welcome when it comes to discovering the nuanced layers of Emirati identity and hopefully you will leave with a deeper understanding of the vibrant and evolving Emirati girlhood today.
