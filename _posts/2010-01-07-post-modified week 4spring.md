## Spring Week 4: Installation Space & User Testing Plan 1

## Installation Space:

Though our idea did not majorly change, we decided that a more personal element would aid in making it a more engaging project and so we decided to focus on the audio aspect and instead of having just music, we will have narrated stories from Emirati girls and their experiences growing up.

1. 2 Projectors

* One for each of the walls. 
* Needs to be able to hang from the ceiling and project on the walls.

2. Sound System / Speakers

* Needed for an audio that will be playing throughout the installation


3. Macbook / Mac Mini

* Needed for the projections/needs to be hidden
