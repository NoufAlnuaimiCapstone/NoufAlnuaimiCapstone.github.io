## Updated Sketch and Audio Idea:

Though our idea did not majorly change, we decided that a more personal element would aid in making it a more engaging project and so we decided to focus on the audio aspect and instead of having just music, we will have narrated stories from Emirati girls and their experiences growing up.

## Changes: 

As Aalya and I were sketching out our segment design on illustrator, we realized that the very geometric shape we currently have did not make a lot of sense with our moveable segment idea. Hence why we decided to make the segments a little smaller and change it to a rounder shape to resemble palm trees better.
