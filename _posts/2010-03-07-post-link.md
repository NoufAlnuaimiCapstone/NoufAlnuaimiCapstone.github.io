## Week 2
### Prototype 2

##### Interests
------
 - UAE culture in relation to being young Emirati
 - Projections
 - Installations
 - Digital storytelling  

##### Rough Idea
------
  An installation that captures the essence of the culture/life of the gulf countries. Although I was initially interested in the possibility of VR in portraying a part of history, I believe the projections suit my skills better and can allow for more possibilities. In addition, I think having projections would allow me to incorporate a physical element that would enhance the interactivity aspect. 

##### Artists I'm looking into for inspiration???
------
  - Rawdha Al Ketbi (cultural elements)
  - Krzysztof Wodiczko (projections)
  - Shahad Alazzaz (cultural installations)
