## Week 2
### Prototype 2

##### Interests/what I'm looking into
------
 - UAE culture in relation to being a young Emirati girl
 - Projections
 - Installations
 - Digital storytelling  
 - Physical interactive elements 
 - Audio

##### Rough Idea
------
 - An installation that consists of a walkway of sand and projections of typically Emirati elements
 - An initial trigger on the walkway that would launch the audio 
 - Physical elements that can trigger different audios 

##### A walk thorugh (the vision)
------
  When the audience first step into the installation with the projections on, an audio would be triggered by motion censors on the ground. The audio initially matches the projections that would be male oriented whether its cultural activites, sports, or just legends usually told to boys. As the audience progress further, the audio and projections start becoming more female oriented with the audio growing more female centered and projections display a side of UAE culture that is mostly kept private. It would be an introductory walk into an expeirnce otherwise very exclusive to young Emirati girls. The audios would consist of stories and lullibies typically sung to girls and expectations they have probably heard growing up. The projections would change into elements associated with being an Emirati girl. Similarly, the objects that the audience can interact with to trigger different audios would also be progressively more centered around the Emirati girl experience.
