   After our one-on-one chat with the instructor, Aalya and I realized how crucial it is to zero in on the specific element we want to work on. We needed to figure out if we should keep our idea as is or make some changes. Initially, we thought it would be a good idea to work on the projections because they’re digital and thus less of a hassle to tweak. However, we ultimately decided to focus on prototyping the palm tree trunk. We settled on the palm tree trunk because we believe it's the element that will grab the most attention. Plus, we needed to see if it's visually appealing and easy to understand, so we wanted to create a prototype for it. Once Aalya and I settled on what we would like to focus and build on, we decided to start prototyping two different versions. One version will stick to our idea of using the tree trunk as the physical element, with various materials symbolizing different stages of an Emirati girl's life journey. The other prototype will be a plain base that can have everything projected onto it.


## First prototype:

     The first prototype is the basic one, where we'd project everything onto it. We started with this one because it's the simpler option. We began by cutting out the various pieces and then assembling them to create a 3D structure. At the start, it looked very geometric and did not resemble a tree trunk at all, luckily Aalya got creative and started carving the sides to give it that real palm tree trunk vibe. This artistic choice not only made the prototype less abstract but also added a visual and conceptual appeal, which got us pretty excited about it as a potential choice. However, we're still missing the palm tree leaves part for now.

## Second prototype:
     The second prototype is the one Aalya and I would like to explore further. This prototype consists of layers of hexagons with an octagon serving as the base. The choice of hexagons was made to abstractly replicate the texture and angles of a palm tree. Additionally, we've incorporated two detachable layers covered in fabric at the top to provide a preview of how our final installation piece might potentially appear.

   At the moment, we're thinking about making the second prototype look better. Honestly, as it stands, it's a bit too abstract for my taste. We're toying with the idea of using materials and fabrics in neutral or brown tones to make it look more like a palm tree. I feel like giving it more texture could also make it more appealing to look at and also interact with.
