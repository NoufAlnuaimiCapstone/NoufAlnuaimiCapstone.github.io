# (actual) Prototypes 
   After our one-on-one chat with the instructor, Aalya and I realized how crucial it is to zero in on the specific element we want to work on. We needed to figure out if we should keep our idea as is or make some changes. Initially, we thought it would be a good idea to work on the projections because they’re digital and thus less of a hassle to tweak. However, we ultimately decided to focus on prototyping the palm tree trunk. We settled on the palm tree trunk because we believe it's the element that will grab the most attention. Plus, we needed to see if it's visually appealing and easy to understand, so we wanted to create a prototype for it. Once Aalya and I settled on what we would like to focus and build on, we decided to start prototyping two different versions. One version will stick to our idea of using the tree trunk as the physical element, with various materials symbolizing different stages of an Emirati girl's life journey. The other prototype will be a plain base that can have everything projected onto it.


## First prototype:

     The first prototype is the basic one, where we'd project everything onto it. We started with this one because it's the simpler option. We began by cutting out the various pieces and then assembling them to create a 3D structure. At the start, it looked very geometric and did not resemble a tree trunk at all, luckily Aalya got creative and started carving the sides to give it that real palm tree trunk vibe. This artistic choice not only made the prototype less abstract but also added a visual and conceptual appeal, which got us pretty excited about it as a potential choice. However, we're still missing the palm tree leaves part for now.

## Second prototype:
     The second prototype is the one Aalya and I would like to explore further. This prototype consists of layers of hexagons with an octagon serving as the base. The choice of hexagons was made to abstractly replicate the texture and angles of a palm tree. Additionally, we've incorporated two detachable layers covered in fabric at the top to provide a preview of how our final installation piece might potentially appear.

   At the moment, we're thinking about making the second prototype look better. Honestly, as it stands, it's a bit too abstract for my taste. We're toying with the idea of using materials and fabrics in neutral or brown tones to make it look more like a palm tree. I feel like giving it more texture could also make it more appealing to look at and also interact with. 



# AMA the art world

### A question: What is interactivity and how much is needed for it to be considered interactive art?

   Throughout this seminar, I have been debating the idea and classification of “interactive” art; what makes art interactive? How is interactive art classified? Does it always need an input and output to be interactive? 
   As I've observed the diverse capstone projects in this class, it has prompted me to consider whether a work of art must incorporate multiple interactive elements to be deemed interactive, or if a single, straightforward interactive feature suffices. Furthermore, I've been questioning whether these interactive aspects are limited to the digital realm or if analog forms of interactivity can also be classified as art.
It's notable that the majority of works identified as interactive art, whether encountered online or within museum exhibitions, often fall into the categories of digital or mechanical. However, I'm curious if there's room for analog forms of interactive art within this classification. Additionally, when it comes to classifying art, I've been contemplating whether these classifications are inherently subjective, reflecting personal interpretations, or if there exist established criteria that delineate the parameters for such categorizations.


### A question: How do you decide on the abstractness or clarity of a niche project when presenting it to a diverse audience?

   Another question that has been occupying my thoughts this semester pertains to the degree of abstractness or clarity in a project. While I fully appreciate the importance of clarity when the objective is to convey a precise message, I also recognize the value of abstraction, even in its subtlest forms, which can allow the audience to craft their own interpretations. Consequently, I find myself wondering where one should delineate the boundary between "this is excessively abstract" and "this is excessively clear and specific." Additionally, I'm curious whether either extreme can be definitively categorized as either advantageous or disadvantageous.
