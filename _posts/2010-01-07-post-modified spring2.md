## Spring Week 3

### Project Progress 

Though no progress has been made yet since we are meeting with the Scene Shop on the 5th, we have sketched out and planned the way we intend for our installation to look.

We still have to refine where we will place the projectors and what they will project but attached below are some AI generated images that roughly showcase how we want our installation to look.

So far, we have sent out an informal and anonymous google form to the university’s girls’ only group on Facebook to collect some perspectives from both Emiratis and Non-Emiratis on what it is like to be in such a multicultural environment. We hope these inputs will help us better shape on installation and cater to different views and experiences. 
Because the responses were fairly limited, we are thinking about sending them out to our friends and other group chats just to have more insights!


## Ideas: 

The generated images made me realize that it would be very neat having the tree in the middle/corner and having things projected on both walls rather than just one only. This will not only fill up the empty space, but would help the project look more attractive and approachable!
