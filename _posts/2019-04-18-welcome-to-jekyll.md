## Week 1
### Prototype 1

##### My interests
------
- Education, social issues, and religion and/or culture.
- Immersive experiences in relation to the history of the gulf.
- Interactive Installations with elements native to the gulf.   

##### Rough Idea
------
  An installation that captures the essence of the culture/life of the gulf countries. Although I was initially interested in the possibility of VR in portraying a part of history, I believe the projections suit my skills better and can allow for more possibilities. In addition, I think having projections would allow me to incorporate a physical element that would enhance the interactivity aspect. 

##### Artists I'm looking into for inspiration???
------
  - Rawdha Al Ketbi 
  - Krzysztof Wodiczko
  - Shahad Alazzaz
