## Idea Progress

While we haven't embarked on any physical experiments just yet, we have outlined a comprehensive plan for the weeks ahead. Below is a rough breakdown:

- Projection Mapping: 
  * Because projections are integral to our project, Aalya and I are eager to start testing the projection of various images on different surfaces. Given that neither Aalya nor I have prior experience with projections, this step is crucial in gauging the feasibility of our projection concept and understanding how we can effectively use this technology or technique to craft comprehensive interactive projections.

- Interactive aspects: 
  * While we haven't settled on the other specific interactive elements to incorporate, we are currently looking into options such as touch or motion sensors to enhance the engagement of our project.

- Future steps:
  * Using projections, we hope to showcase glimpses of traditional Emirati dances, music, and other cultural elements, providing a concise yet powerful insight. These themes are still broad/ vague because we have not yet decided on which specific aspects/imagery we would like to showcase.

  * Because we aim to capture the narrative of an Emirati woman's journey through vibrant visuals and immersive soundscapes, we need to figure out the most suitable ways to portray these elements, like considering whether they should be analog or digital and static or interactive.
