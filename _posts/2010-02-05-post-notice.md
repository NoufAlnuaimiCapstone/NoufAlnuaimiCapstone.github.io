## Cool new concept for our capstone!

    During our countless brainstorm sessions, Aalya and I delved into the vast realm of possibilities for our project. We kicked around the idea of interactive projections on iconic elements like sand dunes and falling sand, elements deeply rooted in UAE's setting. After several rounds of refining our idea, we settled on what truly mattered to us – the interactive wall projections and some sort of physical representations reflecting the stages of an Emirati girl's life.
     As I was looking into my research on artists for my midterm paper, I realized the profound importance and power of language, words, and writings in Gulf culture and beyond. Crafting an element in a specific language might seem niche, but the relatability factor remains strong since nearly every language has its own written form. Feeling the need for more substance in our project, something that could vividly represent the entirety of the UAE, I sought inspiration from artists like Manal AlDowayan, Lulwah Al-Homoud, and Olafur Eliasson.
    Combining Lulwah's creativity in language and digital skills, Manal's focus on women's issues and physical installations, and drawing from Olafur's work in the Qatar desert, where context and local elements played a crucial role, I envisioned a walking installation that would intimately connect the audience with the piece and its surroundings. Allowing them to explore a hidden aspect of the UAE culture all whilst adding their influences to it through the utilization of an interactive QR code and projections.
    After thorough contemplation, I settled on the idea of a physical centerpiece – a palm tree trunk, with its leaves serving as projections. This concept resonates with various aspects, symbolizing the Emirati setting and the journey of growth. To add an extra layer of fun and intrigue, we decided to create the different segments of the palm tree trunk from different Emirati materials and fabrics, each representing distinct stages of an Emirati girl's life journey!
   I believe that this is the idea we will settle and build on because it is very cool and speaks to both Aalya and I well!
