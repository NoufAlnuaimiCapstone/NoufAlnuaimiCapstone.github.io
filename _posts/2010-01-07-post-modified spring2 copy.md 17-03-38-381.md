## Spring Week 4: Installation Space & User Testing Plan 1

## Installation Space:

Though our idea did not majorly change, we decided that a more personal element would aid in making it a more engaging project and so we decided to focus on the audio aspect and instead of having just music, we will have narrated stories from Emirati girls and their experiences growing up.

### Things we need for the installation:
1. 2 Projectors

* One for each of the walls. 
* Needs to be able to hang from the ceiling and project on the walls.

2. Sound System / Speakers

* Needed for an audio that will be playing throughout the installation


3. Macbook / Mac Mini

* Needed for the projections/needs to be hidden


## User Testing Plan 1

### Objectives of User Testing

- **Evaluate Usability:** Determine how intuitively and easily users can interact with the palm tree and understand its symbolic representation.
- **Assess Engagement:** Measure the level of engagement and interest the installation evokes, particularly in relation to the interactive elements and projections.
- **Gather Feedback on Narrative Clarity:** Collect insights on how well the installation communicates the experiences of Emirati girls and the cultural nuances intended to be highlighted.
- **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Pinpoint aspects of the installation that may require refinement or adjustment to better serve the project's goals.

### User Testing Approach & Method 

- **Diverse Audience:** Include participants from various backgrounds, including Emirati locals, expats living in the UAE, and individuals unfamiliar with Emirati culture. This diversity can help assess the project's universal appeal and cultural specificity.
- **Segmented Groups:** Possibly consider segmenting participants based on age, cultural background, and familiarity with Emirati culture to tailor sessions and interpret feedback more effectively.
- **Interactive Sessions:** Conduct sessions where participants interact with the installation. Use observation to analyze engagement and interaction patterns.

### User Testing Setup

- **Location:** Choose a controlled environment that mimics the intended final installation space as closely as possible.
- **Materials Needed:** Ensure the prototype palm tree, projection mock-ups, user feedback forms, and any necessary audio-visual equipment for showing the projection concepts are prepared and functional. In this case, we will mainly focus on the physical elements more than anything else.
    - **Session Structure:** Divide the testing into segments:
    - **Introduction:** Brief participants on the project and its objectives without giving away too much detail that could influence their reactions.
    - **Interaction Phase:** Allow participants to interact with the installation freely while observers take notes.
    - **Feedback Collection:** Conduct interviews and distribute surveys.

### Post-Testing Review

- **Story Comprehension Tasks:** After participants interact with the installation, ask them to narrate or summarize the story they perceived. They could also fill out a survey that covers all main topics and objectives of the project to see whether those points are received. This can highlight which aspects of the narrative are being communicated effectively and which are not.
- **Review Findings:** Gather feedback and analyze it in the context of project goals.
- **Iterate Design:** Based on feedback, make necessary adjustments to the installation design, focusing on enhancing user interaction, narrative clarity, and overall engagement.
- **Plan for Further Testing:** Depending on the outcomes, plan additional rounds of user testing to refine the installation further.
